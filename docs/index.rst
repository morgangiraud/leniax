Leniax documentation
====================

Leniax is a `Lenia<https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html>` simulation library powered by JAX.
It can efficiently simulate and render Lenia worlds and can also be used to search for creatures, initial conditions, kernels and growth functions.
It is also fully differentiable!

For a quick introduction and short example snippets, see our `README
<https://github.com/morgangiraud/leniax/blob/main/README.md>`_.
