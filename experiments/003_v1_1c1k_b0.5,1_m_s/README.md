# 003 - v1, 1c1k, b[0.5,1], m, s

### Decription
In this experiment, we will iterate until the QD algorithm succeeds at finding solitons on Lenia automatically.
The setting is:
- The original Lenia update function
- 1 channel
- 1 kernel
- beta values: [.5, 1]

We are only looking at the following variables:
- m
- s

### Hypothesis
QD algorithms can solve this problem.

### Results
It works!
