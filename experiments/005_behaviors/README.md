# 005 - Behaviors

### Decription
In this experiment, we will increase the complexity of the task by looking at more variables.
Because we move away from the 2 variables setting, we start to use some real behaviors properties of solitons.

Those behaviors are computed as statistics gathered along with the simulation.

The setting is:
- The original Lenia update function
- 1 channel
- 2 kernels

We are looking at the following variables:
- k1 - m
- k1 - s
- k1 - h
- k2 - m
- k2 - s
- k2 - h

Behaviors:
- Mass speed
- Mass density

### Hypothesis
QD algorithms can solve this problem.

### Results
It works!

It's quite satisfying to see an algorithm being so robust!
