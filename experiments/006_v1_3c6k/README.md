# 006 - v1, 3c, 6k

### Decription
In this experiment, we keep increasing the complexity of the task by looking at more variables.

The setting is:
- The original Lenia update function
- 3 channels
- 6 kernels

We are looking at the following variables for each kernel (a total of 18 variables):
- m
- s
- h

Behaviors:
- Mass speed
- Mass density

### Hypothesis
QD algorithms can solve this problem.

### Results
It keeps working!

It's quite satisfying to see an algorithm being so robust!
