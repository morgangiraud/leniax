# 007 - Beta cube 4

### Decription
In this experiment, we finally put to the test our QD algorithm.

How many solitons can the QD algorithm find by looking at all the variations shown in the Bert playground?

Variations consist of looking at what we can call the beta cube. 
We will iterate over all possible trio of beta values by increasing values by `1/4`.

The setting is:
- The original Lenia update function
- 1 channel
- 1 kernel
- Different beta values from [1.] t0 [1., 1., 1.]

We are looking at the following variables:
- m
- s

Behaviors:
- Mass speed
- Mass density

### Hypothesis
QD algorithms can solve this problem.

### Results
After 5 days spent and 500k configuration searched, I ended up with 4k potential creatures as selected by the algorithm!

After a manual (quite intensive) selection of actual unique solitons, we end up with ~200 unique species and hundreds of variations.

Bert has been able to create manually ~400 species according to his website through multiple years of work. 
Of course, Bert had to create this whole research field so the comparison is not straightforward, but I'm pretty happy. 

It feels like a nice achievement!
