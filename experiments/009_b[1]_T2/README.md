# 009 - b[1], T 2

### Decription
In this experiment, we try to see if a different soliton diversity emerge when we change the `T` variables to `2`
The setting is:
- The original Lenia update function
- 1 channel
- 1 kernel
- beta values: [1]

We are only looking at the following variables:
- m
- s

### Hypothesis
The drastic change in `T` can allow the emergence of a new soliton diversity.

### Results
Wrong.

It doesn't change anything.
