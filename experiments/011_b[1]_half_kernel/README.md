# 011 - b[1], half kernel

### Decription
In this experiment, we try to see if we see the emergence of a new diversity by drastically changing the kernel shape.

We do so by cutting manually the kernel in half and running our QD algorithm. (This experiment is not reproducible directly.)

The setting is:
- The original Lenia update function
- 1 channel
- 1 kernel
- beta values: [1]

We are only looking at the following variables:
- m
- s

### Hypothesis
The drastic change in kernel shape can allow the emergence of a new soliton diversity.

### Results
True and False.

Previous solitons can not emerge with this kernel which is drastically biasing the dynamic in a direction in the world.
But outside of waves, nothing much has been found.

It could be interesting to see if there are angles at which solitons can emerge.
