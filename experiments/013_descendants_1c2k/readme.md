# 013 - Descendants 1c2k

In this experiemtn we are only exploring different inits in a 2d1c2k setting.
The 2 kernels are coming from the first collection and are matched 2 by 2.

Results: ok

Note:
Doing init exploration seems enough to find stable patterns in this setting but there is not much novelty in the creature found.
I suspect that adding channels will be much more interesting.
Not sure if I should spend the time exploring and curating all those potential results? Let's first explore how the the QD algorithm is working in the 2 and 3 channel settings.
