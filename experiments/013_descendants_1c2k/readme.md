# 013 - Descendants 1c2k

### Decription
In this experiment, we are only exploring different inits in a 2d1c2k setting.
The 2 kernels are coming from the first collection and are matched 2 by 2.

### Hypothesis
1 new channel solitons exist at the intersection of existing solitons using 2 kernels

### Results
Right.

Doing initialization exploration seems enough to find solitons in this setting but there is not much novelty in the creature found.

I suspect that adding channels will be much more interesting.

Not sure if I should spend the time exploring and curating all those potential results? Let's first explore how the QD algorithm is working when looking for descendants in the 2 and 3 channels settings.
