# 014 - 2 channels

In this experiment we explore how the current QD algorithm works in the following settings
- 2 channels
- 4 kernels (kernels can influence eachothers)

2 variations:
- raw search
- 1 kernel frozen to orbium found in experiment 014_2channels

Goal: See if the current QD algorithm scale well to this setting

Results: ok in both settings

Notes:
Creatures are surpringly interesting and the algorithm is working well. Gives me hope that it will scale to higher dimensions.
