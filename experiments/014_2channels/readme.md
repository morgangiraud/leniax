# 014 - 2 channels

### Decription
In this experiment, we explore how the current QD algorithm works in 

The setting is:
- The original Lenia update function
- 1 channel
- 2 kernels

2 variations:
- raw search
- 1 kernel frozen to Orbium found in experiment 014_2channels

### Hypothesis
Current QD algorithm scale well to this setting.

### Results
Right in both settings

The solitons are surprisingly interesting and the algorithm is working well!

Gives me hope that it will scale to higher dimensions!
