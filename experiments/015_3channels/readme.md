# 015 - 3 channels

### Decription

In this experiment, we explore how the current QD algorithm works.

The setting is:
- 3 channels
- 9 kernels (kernels can influence each others)
- 4 kernels frozen to one of the children of Orbium found in experiment 014_2channels

### Hypothesis
See if the current QD algorithm scale well to this setting

### Results
True.

Surprisingly it feels as if it is easier to find interesting and diverse creatures in this more complex setting.

To validate this intuition, I would need to run a raw search over the 9 kernels. It might be possible, that because some of the kernels are already frozen to an existing creature, it eases the search for more complex ones.

To be continued.
