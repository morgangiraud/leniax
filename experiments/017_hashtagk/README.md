# 016 - Hashtag kernel

### Decription
In this experiment, we are looking at esoteric kernels.

In this case, a hashtag kernel: #

The setting is:
- The original Lenia update function
- 3 channel
- 9 kernels

We are looking at the following variables:
- all growth function parameters

Behaviors:
- Mass speed
- Mass density

### Hypothesis
New interesting solitons can emerge by using esoteric kernels.

### Results
True!

It found more than 50 potential solitons.

I'm still amazed how the QD algorithm can generalize even though I'm using simple heuristics to constraint it!
