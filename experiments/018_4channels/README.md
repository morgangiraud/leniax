# 015 - 4 channels

### Decription
In this experiment, we explore how the current QD algorithm works in the following settings
- 4 channels (1 hidden channel)
- 15 kernels (kernels can influence each others)

### Hypothesis
The current QD algorithm scale well to this setting.

### Results
True.

But I don't see much new diversity.
