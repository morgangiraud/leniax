# 020 - Multi Lenia

### Description
In this experiment, we try to see if can learn kernels and growth functions in a multi-channel setting to render different 1-channel Lenia.

### Hypothesis
Using hidden channels and a special encoding in those channels we can simulate different 1 channel Lenia with only one set of kernels/growth functions.

### Results
